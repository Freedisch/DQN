# Deep Q-Learning Hospital Navigation Agent

## Project Overview

This project implements a reinforcement learning agent using Deep Q-Learning to navigate a simulated hospital environment. The agent, representing a nurse assistant, must efficiently navigate a 5x5 grid to reach a medicine cabinet while avoiding collisions with doctors and nurses.

## Environment Description

- 5x5 grid representing a hospital floor
- Agent: Nurse assistant (ðŸ™‚)
- Static objects: 5 Beds, 1 Medicine Cabinet, 1 Doctor, 1 Nurse
- Actions: Move Up, Down, Left, Right
- Rewards:
  - Reaching Medicine Cabinet: +10
  - Reaching a Bed: +1
  - Colliding with Doctor or Nurse: -5
  - Each step: -0.1 (to encourage efficiency)
- Termination Conditions:
  - Reaching the Medicine Cabinet (success)
  - Colliding with Doctor or Nurse (failure)
  - Max steps reached (100 steps)

## Project Structure

- `HospitalNavigation_env.py`: Custom Gym environment implementation
- `train.py`: Script to train the DQN agent
- `play.py`: Script to run simulations with the trained agent
- `hospital_navigation_weights.h5f`: Saved weights of the trained model
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```
